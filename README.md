# Data-Visualization-of-Sleep-Healty-and-Lifestyle
This repository contains data visualization results of sleep health patterns and lifestyle factors using Power BI. The goal of this project is to explore how different aspects of daily habits—such as physical activity, stress level, and BMI—affect sleep quality and the presence of sleep disorders.

Sleep is a crucial component of overall health, and disruptions in sleep can be linked to various lifestyle factors. Using a synthetic dataset designed to simulate realistic health data, this project visualizes patterns and relationships between demographic information, physical activity, and sleep-related outcomes.

**Dataset Source**
The dataset can be accessed through Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data)

Disclaimer: This dataset is synthetic and was created for illustrative and educational purposes. Although not based on real-world data, the structure closely resembles actual sleep health records, making it suitable for analytical practice and portfolio projects.


**Key Insights from the Visualization**

This project reveals several important patterns related to sleep health and lifestyle based on the dataset:

**1. Balanced Gender Distribution**
The dataset includes 189 male (50.53%) and 185 female (49.47%) participants, providing a well-balanced gender representation.

**2. Most Participants Do Not Have Sleep Disorders**
58.56% of the participants reported no sleep disorder, while the remaining were split between Sleep Apnea (20.86%) and Insomnia (20.59%).

**3. Sleep Duration by Age Shows a Wide Distribution**
Participants range from 27 to 59 years old, with the highest count at age 43. This indicates that sleep health issues affect a broad range of working-age individuals.

**4. Daily Physical Activity Varies by Profession**
Professions like Nurses (8,057 steps/day) and Lawyers (7,661) have the highest physical activity levels, while Sales Representatives recorded the lowest (3,000 steps/day).

**5. BMI Impacts Heart Rate and Activity**
Obese participants have the highest average heart rate (84.30 bpm) and the lowest daily steps (3,350), whereas individuals with a normal BMI show healthier heart rates and higher physical activity.

**6. Sleep Quality Is Best Among Those with Normal BMI**
Participants with a normal BMI report the highest average sleep quality (7.66 hours), while obese individuals have the lowest (6.4 hours), indicating a strong relationship between weight and sleep health.

**7. Physical Activity Levels Are Affected by Both Sleep Disorders and BMI**
Interestingly, overweight individuals with Sleep Apnea show the highest physical activity (78.37 minutes/day), suggesting possible behavioral adaptations or treatment efforts.
